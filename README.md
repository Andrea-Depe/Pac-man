# Pac-man
IMPORTANT: TO START THE GAME, OPEN THE PacManGUI.py IN A COMPILER SUCH AS VS CODE AND RUN THE FILE. 

This is my version of Pac-man, the game was developed in python, for a university project. The game includes two modes, the classic mode where there are 4 ghosts and the Hard mode where there are 8 ghosts, the goal of the game as in any pac-man is to eat all the biscuits
